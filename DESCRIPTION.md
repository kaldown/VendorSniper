Never miss a limited-supply vendor restock. VendorSniper watches for items you want, alerts you when they're in stock, and lets you buy them all with one click.

## Features

- **Vendor scanning** - Automatically detects limited-supply items when you open a vendor
- **Watchlist** - Mark items to watch across any vendor, persists between sessions
- **Quantity targets** - Set how many you need; tracks progress and stops when complete
- **Stock alerts** - Raid warning sound and screen flash when watched items are available
- **One-click buying** - "Buy All" button purchases all watched items instantly
- **Purchase log** - Track what was bought, when, and from which vendor
- **Minimap button** - Left-click to toggle window

## Usage

1. Visit a vendor with limited-supply items
2. VendorSniper shows limited items with checkboxes
3. Check items you want to watch (shift-click for custom quantity)
4. Next time you visit a vendor with those items in stock, you get an alert
5. Click "Buy All" to purchase everything on your watchlist

**Tip:** Items are watched globally - they'll be detected at any vendor that sells them, not just the one you added them from.
