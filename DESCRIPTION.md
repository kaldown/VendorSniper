Never miss a limited-supply vendor restock again. Park an alt at a vendor, pick the items you want, and VendorSniper auto-buys them the instant they restock.

## Features

- **Auto-buy on vendor open** - Automatically purchases watched items when you open any vendor
- **Global watchlist** - Watch items across any vendor, persists between sessions
- **Quantity targets** - Set how many you need; VendorSniper tracks progress and stops when complete
- **Raid warning alerts** - Screen flash and looping sound when a purchase is made (toggleable with `/vs alert`)
- **Auto-close merchant** - Optional: closes vendor window after scan for external reopen cycle
- **Purchase log** - Track what was bought, when, and from which vendor
- **Minimap button** - Left-click to toggle window

## Usage

1. Visit a vendor that sells limited-supply items
2. VendorSniper shows limited items with checkboxes
3. Check items to watch (shift-click for custom quantity)
4. Next time you visit any vendor with those items in stock, they are bought automatically
5. A raid warning alert fires on each purchase
